BigInteger
==========

Library for working with high-precision integers. Integers are stored in an array int[], which is filled by individual digits of stored integer. It is designed to work with 32-bit numbers and to convert them quickly from stored array to output (string), therefore the integers are stored as if they were numbers in base 10^9.
It offers basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo.
It also offers comparation and outputing or converting the number into std::string.
